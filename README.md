### About Me



### Technologies

- I first coded whan I was really young: on the comodore 64. After a lot of other things in life ( music and drawing) I finally found coding back a few years ago.
- A lot was changed and I was mezzmerized by the fastness and smartness of all.
I got a Full-Stack certicate by WINC Academy in Amsterdam.
A lot did come across: HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, Typescript, Tailwind, React, Nextjs, Peewee, Gunicorn, 
At this momnet I really like to explore more of combinations with art and webdevelopment.
The NEXTjs projects are really amaizing and the development in animation are also awesome.
A simple audio player is now in progress.  A small audio player for a punk-rock band so its like a little walkman online with only 1 album on it.
