### About Me

- üåç I live in beautiful Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
- üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a passionate coder who enjoys the thrill of solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions.
- üíº Currently on the lookout for new job opportunities in the field of coding.


### Technologies

I embarked on my coding journey at a young age, starting with the Commodore 64. Years later, I rediscovered my passion for coding and was amazed by the rapid evolution of the tech world. In pursuit of my enthusiasm, I earned a Full-Stack certificate from WINC Academy in Amsterdam, expanding my skills in a variety of languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind, React, Next.js, Peewee, and Gunicorn.

At this moment, I'm captivated by the fusion of art and web development. Working with NEXT.js has been particularly exciting, and I'm delving into the world of web animations. I'm currently working on a project that involves creating a simple audio player for a punk-rock band‚Äîa digital walkman showcasing their album. 

Join me on this journey as I explore the boundaries of creativity and technology in the ever-evolving world of web development!
